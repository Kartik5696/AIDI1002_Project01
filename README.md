# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Time-Series

Problem Statement:
The challenge of this project is to accurately predict the future closing value of a given stock across a given period of time in the future. For this project I will use a Long Short-Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” to predict the closing price of the S&P 500 using a dataset of past prices.

Goals:
1. Explore stock prices. 
2. Implement basic model using linear regression
3. Implement LSTM using Keras library.
